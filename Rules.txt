Hello
My name is Mihaly, and this is my first game and also my first reference work. 
Please ignore the beauty and outfit of the game, it's about the mechanism and the skills.
If you have read the first sentences, you are proven to be committed to play with the game Crop Up!
Here are the rules.
1. You have 30 minutes to get as much money as you can, by growing, harvesting and selling different plants.
2. The more money you have on your bank account, the worthier plant you can plant.
3. Duplicating your capital provides you the opportunity to automate the planting and harvesting proccess.
Your opponent is always yourself and the time. Keep your eye on the countdown timer, choose the plants wisely and enjoy.
